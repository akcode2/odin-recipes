        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 ½ ounces chopped dark chocolate</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Generously butter the inside of 4 (5 1/2 ounce) ramekins. 
            Place them in a casserole dish. </li>
        <li> Whisk together egg yolks, eggs, and sugar in a bowl until 
            light, foamy, and lemon colored. </li>
        <li> Melt chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second 
            intervals, stirring after each melting, 1 to 3 minutes. </li>
        <li> Stir melted chocolate mixture into egg and sugar mixture until combined. </li>
        <li> Sift cocoa powder into the mixture; stir to combine. </li>
        <li>  Sift flour and salt into the mixture; stir to combine into a batter. </li>
        <li> Stir vanilla extract into the batter. </li>
        <li> Transfer batter to a resealable plastic bag. Snip one corner of the bag with 
            scissors to create a tip. </li>
        <li> Divide batter evenly between the prepared ramekins; tap gently on the counter 
            to remove any air bubbles. </li>
        <li> Refrigerate 30 minutes. </li>
        <li> Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). </li>
        <li> Arrange the ramekins in a casserole dish. Pour enough hot tap water into the casserole 
            dish to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated over for 15-18 minutes. Set aside to cool for 15 minutes. </li>
        <li> Loosen the edges from the ramekin with a knife. Invert each cake onto a plate and dust
             with powdered sugar. </li>
    </ol>
